    "# TouchTerrain standalone in a jupyter notebook\n",
    "Chris Harding, Dec. 24, 2022 (<charding@iastate.edu>)\n",
    "\n",
    "- This jupyter notebook runs a standalone version of TouchTerrain, similar to `TouchTerrain_standalone.py`\n",
    "- This notebook needs to be run in Python __3.x__  \n",
    "- If you're using this via the touchterrain_jupyter docker container, ignore all the install stuff that follows. The image will already contain nearly all packages, except for the touchterrain module itself, which you should already have installed via the install_touchterrain.sh shell script. You might want to rename/save this notebook into something other than TouchTerrain_standalone_jupyter_notebook.ipnb b/c if you ever update the touchterrain module from github (update_touchterrain.sh) it will overwrite it!\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use pip to build and install a package called touchterrain (all lowercase!), which contains all functions needed to run in standalone and in server mode. This will also install all dependencies needed(!)\n",
    "- you can run pip either in a terminal or inside a jupyter cell (see cell below)\n",
    "- to run it in a separate terminal, `cd` to the folder that contains the `setup.py` file (which will contain a folder called touchterrain)\n",
    "    - enter:  `pip install .` \n",
    "    - note the . at the end, which will make pip run the script in setup.py\n",
    "    - this will install all dependencies (including earthengine-api) \n",
    "- You will also need to install __gdal__ which can be tricky when using pip as it requires a C++ compiler. Because of many Windows users not wanting to go that route, it's commented out in setup.py, but if you do have a working compiler you can uncomment it and see if it works with pip.\n",
    "- On Windows you could get the whl file for your version of Python from [here](https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/) and install it separately with `pip install <whl file>` (Note that this is sadly no longer being updated!)\n",
    "- gdal is also available via [conda-forge](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/gdal) and if you have conda installed you could try: `conda install -c conda-forge gdal` \n",
    "- Finally. there are two optional modules which you may want to install via pip as well:\n",
    "    - `pip install geemap`  will allow you to use an interactive in-cell map to digitize the print area\n",
    "    - `pip install k3d` will allow you to preview your STL file in a 3D viewer\n",
