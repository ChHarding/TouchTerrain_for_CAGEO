    "# TouchTerrain standalone in a jupyter notebook\n",

    "\n",
    "- this jupyter notebook runs a standalone version of TouchTerrain, similar to `TouchTerrain_standalone.py`\n",
    "- this notebook needs to be run in Python __3.x__  (I'm using 3.7)\n",
    "- I assume you've installed anaconda or miniconda and have the standard 3.party packages already installed (e.g. numpy, pillow (aka PIL), etc.)\n",
    "- the following additional packages are required, either use (ana)conda or pip to install:\n",
    "    - earthengine-api __ONLY if you want to use Google Earth Engine's (GEE) online DEM data, NOT needed for converting local DEM raster files (geotiffs)__ \n",
    "    - gdal (On windows, if conda gives you trouble, get the whl file from [here](https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/) and install via `pip install <whl file>`\n",
    "    - vectors: \n",
    "        - do NOT use the default pip repo, as it's pointing to an outdated version of verctors! \n",
    "        - Instead, go to https://github.com/allelos/vectors and download the zip file. \n",
    "        - Unzip it (will be verctors-master), open a terminal, cd to the unzipped folder and run `python setup.py install` to install it.\n",
    "        - If you're using anaconda, you can open a terminal with Environments -> <your environment, typically __base__> -> left click on green arrow -> Open Terminal\n",
    "        - `cd <folder with unzipped vectors-master)`\n",
    "        - `python setup.py install`\n",

    "- You don't need this if you only want to import terrain from locally stored raster files (geotiffs)!\n",
    "- TouchTerrain can use DEM data from Google Earth Engine (given the corners of the area), but you need to first request a developer account and set up an authentication file\n",
    "- (This dev account is different from your standard Google (Gmail, etc.) account!)\n",
    "- Getting the account is free and entitles you to a modest number of requests (4 per seconds), which are also free. To request got to https://signup.earthengine.google.com/, you'll get and email with a file. \n",
    "- refer to the part __Setting Up Authentication Credentials__ https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/python_install_manual (ignore the stuff above it, as you should already have installed all the needed packages when you installed the earthengine-api package ...)"
