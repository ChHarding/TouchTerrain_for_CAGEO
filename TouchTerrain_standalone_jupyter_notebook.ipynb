    "- this notebook needs to be run in Python __3.x__  (I'm using 3.7)\n",
    "- Use pip to build and install a package called touchterrain (all lowercase!), which contains all functions needed to run in standalone and in server mode. This will also install all dependencies needed(!)\n",
    "- you can run pip either in a terminal or inside a jupyer cell (next cell)\n",
    "- to run it in a separate terminal, `cd` to the folder that contains the `setup.py` file (which will contain a folder called touchterrain)\n",
    "    - enter:  `pip install .` \n",
    "    - note the . at the end, which will make pip run the script in setup.py\n",
    "    - this will install all dependencies (including earthengine-api) \n",
    "\n",
    "- on windows, if pip gives you trouble with __gdal__, get the whl file from [here](https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/) and install it separatly with `pip install <whl file>` then go back and try the full install again\n",
