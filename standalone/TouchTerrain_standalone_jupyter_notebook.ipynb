    "- the following additional packages are required, either use (ana)conda or pip to install:\n",
    "    - gdal (On windows, if conda gives you trouble, get the whl file from [here](https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/) and install via `pip install <whl file>`\n",
    "    - vectors: install via `pip install vectors`\n",
    "    - earthengine-api (ONLY if you want to use Google Earth Engine's (GEE) online DEM data, NOT needed for converting local DEM raster files (geotiffs) \n",

    "- (This dev account is different from your standard Google (Gmail, etc.) account!)\n",
    "- Getting the account is free and entitles you to a modest number of requests (4 per seconds), which are also free. To request got to https://signup.earthengine.google.com/, you'll get and email with a file. \n",
    "- refer to the part __Setting Up Authentication Credentials__ https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/python_install_manual (ignore the stuff above it, as you should already have installed all the needed packages when you installed the earthengine-api package ...)"
