    "- This notebook is meant for users who are new to jupyter notebooks and Python. It walks through the process of using TouchTerrain with many more small steps at a slower pace, makes less assumptions and gives more explanations - but will also hide some advanced details.\n",
    "- It assumes that you are using it via the touchterrain docker container and that you have downloaded the docker image from https://github.com/ChHarding/TouchTerrain_jupyter_docker (which contains a complete Linux system with all packages and libraries needed for TouchTerrain), have created the touch_terrain docker container, have run the install script and have started a local jupyter server via the run script.\n",
    "- This notebook is a companion to the more generic TouchTerrain_standalone_jupyter_notebook.ipynb. Once you've worked through starter notebook and are more familiar with TouchTerrain, you may want to graduate to it as it can be more efficient and faster to work with.\n",
    "- Before we start, you may want to rename this notebook into e.g. TouchTerrain_starter_chris.ipynb) to make sure it doesn't get overwritten by accident. "

    "## Final thoughts\n",
    "- You can now download your zipfile from the tmp folder and unzip it to 3D print the STL file.\n",
    "- In the jupyter file manager (tree), navigate to the folder that contains the file (tmp) and select the zip file via the checkbox on the left. A Download button will appear at the top, click it to download the zip file to your native operating system (Win10 or Mac).\n",
    "- If you want to upload files, use the Upload button in the upper right.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How to quit and resume working on this notebook\n",
    "- As you worked through the notebook, you changed the content of its cells and also created output cells. These changes are automatically saved every couple of minutes. Hit the floppy icon to save manually now.\n",
    "- If you're OK with keeping the container running in the background you can close the jupyter browser windows. To resume, just copy/paste the 127.0.0.1 URL again. Or you could just leave the browser windows running.\n",
    "- If you want to exit (stop) the container, make sure to save your notebook first. Then, open the Docker Desktop App, find the (running) touchterrain_container under Containers. Hit STOP (__but not DELETE!__) to exit the container. This will also terminate the jupyter server, so you can close its browser windows.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Resuming (from a \"sleeping\" container)\n",
    "- Although you've exited the container, anything you created or changed within the container is still saved despite being stopped. \n",
    "- To resume working with the notebook, open the Docker Desktop App and find the exited (stopped) touchterrain_container under Containers on the right. \n",
    "- Click on START and then on CLI, this will give you a container terminal. \n",
    "- Type in `bash` and hit enter (this will give you a nicer type of shell). Now type `./run` and hit the tab key, this will result in `./run_touchterrain.sh`. \n",
    "- Hit Enter and note the URL starting with 127.0.0.1 that comes up. Copy this URL (with the long token string at the end!) and paste it into a browser. \n",
    "- Click on your notebook to resume working with it, it will have all the changes since the last save, including most of the output (except the interactive map and 3D viz).\n",
    "- To avoid confusion, it's best to clear the output cells and start with a clean slate. Under Kernel, run Restart and Clear Output. Now start running cells from the top (except the authorization cell).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Updates \n",
    "- At some point, it may be necessary to update either the TouchTerrain module or the entire docker image. For example, there may be new functionality that you want to use. In both cases, your work will be lost or overwritten, so it's imperative to save any files you want to carry over to the updated system first (i.e., download them). This may include your notebook file or any models (zip files) you have created, via the Download button in jupyter.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Help, I deleted my container!\n",
    "- If you removed your container via the Docker Desktop app, either accidentally or b/c you downloaded (pulled) a new docker image, you need to use a OS terminal (PowerShell on Win10 or Terminal.app on Mac) and start the container again using `docker run`. \n",
    "- After running the container, you will again have to run the install script (`./install_touchterrain.sh`) and then run jupyter with `./run_touchterrain.sh` and copy/paste the `127.0.0.1` URL into your browser.\n",
    "- For more see https://github.com/ChHarding/TouchTerrain_jupyter_docker#download-the-image-and-run-the-container\n",
    "- Once jupyter is running, re-upload anything you need (notebook, data) to the container and resume working"
